## Part 1
### Summary:
In this part we used different embedding methods, as well as a simple implementation of a LSTM deep learning model, for sentiment analysis on the IMDB reviews dataset. <br>
### Pipeline:
1. Data loading - read files and combine them to one DataFrame. Can be seen in `data_loading.ipynb`.

2. Pre-Process: "Clean" dataset to remove stop words, stem words etc. So we can have a smaller dictionary of words.

3. Create word embeddings with Glove and Word2Vec.

4. Create LSTM implementation

5. Run models with different embedding methods and parameters and compare results.

6. Result analysis.
